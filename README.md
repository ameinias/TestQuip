# TestQuip1
Choose the most specific "quip", based on how many tags match a list of variables, from an XML file. Update the XML file from a form. 

Intended to be used for barks, but could be adapted to pull any tagged info from an XML file.

#Usage
The XML file must be saved in the root Resources folder if you are using the Add Quip form. 

This tool only chooses a random relevant quip from the XML file and displays in in a Text object, based on variables entered in the inspector. 

Displaying the quips in a dialog system and in-game variable management not included. The variables are analyzed by existing in the list at all. There is no mechanic for analyzing a boolean or weighting variables.
